## PROBLEM STATEMENT
* Analyze and understand market trends and consumer preferences in the used car industry.
* Provide insights to aid decision-making processes for car dealerships and automotive businesses.
* Examine factors such as price, mileage, fuel type, and ownership to identify patterns and correlations.
* Optimize inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts based on insights derived from the analysis.
* Enhance competitiveness, customer satisfaction, and profitability in the used car market.

## ANALYSIS TASK
**Data Cleaning**:
Appropriate actions were taken for the "Price" and "Driven (Kms)" columns to handle missing values, outliers, or any other inconsistencies.

**EMI Price Filtering**:
Car details were retrieved where the EMI price is greater than the median price of EMI for all listed cars and less than the mean price of EMI for all listed cars.

**Car Names Analysis**:
The number of car names starting with "Alto" was determined.

**Average Price by Gear Type**:
For each car brand, the average price of cars with manual and automatic gears was calculated. Any significant price difference between the two types was examined.

**Fuel Type Analysis**:
The most common fuel type among the listed cars was identified, along with any other fuel types gaining popularity.

**City-wise Average Car Price**:
The city with the highest and lowest average car prices was determined.

**Correlation Analysis**:
The correlation between the number of kilometers driven and the car's price was explored to determine if cars with lower mileage tend to have higher prices.

**Average Car Age Analysis**:
The present average age of cars in the dataset was calculated, along with differences in average age for different car brands.

**Car Ownership Distribution**:
The overall distribution of car ownership (first-hand vs. second-hand) in the dataset was analyzed.

**EMI Amount by Ownership**:
Changes in the average EMI amount with car ownership (first-hand vs. second-hand) were examined.

**Model Year and Driven Kms Correlation**:
Any correlation between the "Model Year" and the number of kilometers driven ("Driven (Kms)") was investigated.
